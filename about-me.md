# About me

I am a software developer passionate about your project and solving your customer's needs and business objectives.

Three things that set me apart: a visual eye, excellent troubleshooting skills, and exceptional communication skills.

Let's just put it out there, I'm no designer, but I do understand what looks good.

I have a fantastic ability to troubleshoot problems by deconstructing and finding the underlying issues. Solving problems even in highly stressful situations.

I communicate extremely well. I've always felt that this is something that most software developers lack. I noticed that communication breakdown can have a significant impact on projects, budgets and investments. I'm here for you and want to solve your challenges.
